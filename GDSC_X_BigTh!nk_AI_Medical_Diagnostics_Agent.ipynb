    "# Workshop: Building an AI Medical Diagnosis Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! In this workshop, we'll build a smart AI Agent that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Chat with a user** to understand their symptoms.\n",
    "2.  **Decide** when it has gathered enough information to move to research.\n",
    "3.  **Use external tools** (like Perplexity's API) to narrow down medical conditions.\n",
    "4.  **Analyze the findings** and the conversation.\n",
    "5.  **Generate a structured report.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a simplified version of a preliminary medical consultation (but **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** this is for educational purposes ONLY and is NOT a substitute for real medical advice (yet)!).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this interesting?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LLMs as Orchestrators:** We'll see how Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google's Gemini can evolve beyond only generating text and also *control a workflow*, make decisions, and use tools.\n",
    "* **LangChain & LangGraph:** We'll use these powerful libraries designed to make building complex AI applications easier. LangGraph helps create reliable, step-by-step AI processes through state management.\n",
    "* **Real-world Pattern:** Similar patterns to this one (chat -> gather info -> use tools -> synthesize) are common in many professions, and can be leveraged to automate real jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Today's Goal:** Understand the components and logic needed to create this agent and run it interactively. Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:** Gemini and Perplexity API. We'll explain the AI concepts as we go!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's draw the basic flow in our notebooks:\n",
    "[User Input] -> [Chatbot Conversation] -> [Research Step] -> [Analysis Step] -> [Final Report]"

Infectious Mononucleosis (Mono)**\\n- **Explanation:** Mono is a viral infection most commonly caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It typically presents with severe fatigue, low-grade fever, swollen and tender lymph nodes (especially under the jaw and in the neck), sore throat, and sometimes decreased appetite and brain fog[1][3].\\n- **Causes:** EBV is transmitted primarily through saliva (\"kissing disease\"), but can also spread via shared utensils or close contact[1].\\n- **Risk Factors:** Adolescents and young adults are most commonly affected. Recent close contact with infected individuals increases risk. Camping trips can increase exposure to various pathogens, including EBV[1].\\n- **Key Features Matching Case:** Severe fatigue, intermittent low-grade fever, excessive sleep, brain fog, decreased appetite, and tender lumps under the jaw (swollen lymph nodes) are classic for mono[1][3].\\n\\n**2. Other Viral Infections**\\n- **Explanation:** Various viruses (e.g., cytomegalovirus, influenza, adenovirus) can cause systemic symptoms including fatigue, fever, and lymphadenopathy. These are often self-limited.\\n- **Causes:** Transmission is typically via respiratory droplets or close contact.\\n- **Risk Factors:** Recent exposure to sick contacts, crowded environments, or travel (including camping)[5].\\n- **Key Features Matching Case:** Fatigue, fever, and swollen lymph nodes are common in viral infections, though mono is more classic for the described severity and duration[2][5].\\n\\n**3. Lymphoma**\\n- **Explanation:** Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. Symptoms can include persistent swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, fever, and sometimes night sweats or weight loss[2].\\n- **Causes:** The exact cause is often unknown, but risk increases with certain infections (e.g., EBV), immune suppression, or family history.\\n- **Risk Factors:** More common in older adults, but can occur at any age. Persistent, non-tender, and progressively enlarging lymph nodes are more concerning for lymphoma[2].\\n- **Key Features Matching Case:** Fatigue and swollen lymph nodes are present, but the acute onset and associated fever make infection more likely. Lymphoma is less likely but should be considered if symptoms persist or worsen[2].\\n\\n**4. Other Causes**\\n- **Bacterial lymphadenitis:** Usually presents with more localized pain, redness, and sometimes pus.\\n- **Autoimmune conditions:** Can cause fatigue and lymphadenopathy but are less likely with this acute presentation[5].\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Potential Diagnostic Steps\\n\\n- **Physical Examination:** Assess for additional lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, pharyngitis, or rash[1][5].\\n- **Blood Tests:**\\n  - **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Look for atypical lymphocytes (suggestive of mono) or cytopenias.\\n  - **Monospot Test or EBV Serology:** To confirm infectious mononucleosis[1][3].\\n  - **Other Viral Serologies:** If mono is negative, consider CMV or other viral panels.\\n- **Throat Swab:** If sore throat is present, to rule out streptococcal infection.\\n- **Liver Function Tests:** Mild elevation is common in mono.\\n- **Imaging (if indicated):** Ultrasound of lymph nodes if persistent, large, or atypical.\\n- **Lymph Node Biopsy:** Only if lymphadenopathy persists beyond several weeks, is hard/fixed, or other concerning features arise (to rule out lymphoma)[5].\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Authoritative Sources\\n\\n- Johns Hopkins Medicine: Infectious Mononucleosis[1]\\n- Mount Sinai: Mononucleosis[3]\\n- Lymphoma Action: Lymphoma Symptoms[2]\\n- Mayo Clinic: Swollen Lymph Nodes[4]\\n- Healthdirect: Swollen Lymph Nodes[5]\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Summary Table\\n\\n| Condition                  | Key Symptoms                      | Typical Duration | Risk Factors                | Diagnostic Steps                |\\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|\\n| Infectious Mononucleosis   | Fatigue, fever, lymphadenopathy   | 1–2 months       | Young age, close contact    | CBC, Monospot, EBV serology     |\\n| Other Viral Infections     | Fatigue, fever, lymphadenopathy   | Days–weeks       | Recent exposure, travel     | CBC, viral serologies           |\\n| Lymphoma                   | Fatigue, persistent lymph nodes   | Weeks–months     | Age, immune suppression     | CBC, imaging, biopsy if needed  |\\n\\n---\\n\\n**In summary:** The most probable diagnosis is infectious mononucleosis, given the combination of severe fatigue, intermittent low-grade fever, excessive sleep, brain fog, decreased appetite, and tender lymph nodes under the jaw, especially following a recent camping trip[1][3]. Other viral infections are possible, and lymphoma is less likely but should be considered if symptoms persist or worsen. Diagnostic steps should begin with a physical exam and targeted blood tests.'}, 'delta': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ''}}]}\n",

    "Congratulations! You've built and interacted with a multi-step AI agent using LangGraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LLMs can orchestrate:** They don't just generate text; they can follow steps, use tools, and make autonomous decisions within a defined structure.\n",
    "* **LangGraph provides structure:** It allows us to build complex, stateful AI workflows reliably by defining nodes (steps) and edges (transitions).\n",
    "* **State is crucial:** Managing the conversation history, intermediate results, and current stage is essential for multi-turn interactions for complex tasks.\n",
    "* **Tools enhance LLMs:** Giving LLMs access to external APIs or functions dramatically increases their capabilities, making them experts at tasks.\n",
    "* **Prompting is key:** Carefully crafted prompts (System prompts, prompts for nodes. tools) guide the AI's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further Exploration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add more tools (e.g., a calculator, a database lookup).\n",
    "* Experiment with different LLMs or prompt strategies on new use cases.\n",
    "* Explore LangSmith for debugging and tracing your graph runs."
